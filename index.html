            <b>Kudremukha</b> is the name of a mountain range and an individual mountain
            peak located in Chikmagalur district, Karnataka, India. It is also the name
            of a small hill station and an iron ore-mining town situated near the
            mountain, about 20 kilometres from Kalasa in Kalasa Taluk. The name
            Kuduremukha literally means "horse-faced" in Kannada and refers to a
            picturesque view of a side of the mountain that resembles a horse's face.
            Historically, it was also referred to as 'Samseparvata', since it was
            approached from Samse village. Kuduremukha is Karnataka's 2nd highest peak
            after Mullayanagiri and the 26th highest peak in the Western Ghats. The
            nearest International Airport is at Mangalore (99 km away). The Kudremukha
            National Park in the Western Ghats is part of the world's 38 ‘hottest
            hotspots’ of biological diversity, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

            The Kudremukha National Park (latitude 13°01'00" to 13°29'17" N, longitude
            75°00'55" to 75°25'00" E) is the second-largest Wildlife Protected Area
            (600.32 km²) belonging to a tropical wet evergreen type of forest in the
            Western Ghats. Kudremukha National Park is located at the tri-junction of
            Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Chikmagalur districts of Karnataka. The Western
            Ghats is one of the thirty-four hotspots identified for biodiversity
            conservation in the world. Kudremukha National Park comes under the Global
            Tiger Conservation Priority-I, under a format developed jointly by the
            Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and World Wide Fund-USA.

          <p>
            The town of Kudremukha (KIOCL & others) lies at an elevation of around 815
            metres (2,674 ft), whereas the peak stands at 1,894 metres (6,214 ft). The
            southern and western sides of the park form the steep slopes of the Western
            Ghats ridgeline, with altitudes varying from 100 m to 1,892 m (peak). The
            northern, central, and eastern portions of the park consist of rolling hills
            with a mosaic of natural grasslands and shola forests. Kudremukha receives an
            average annual rainfall of about 7000 mm, largely due to its evergreen forest
            cover.

            <b>National Park:</b> Well-known environmentalist and tiger expert
            <b>K Ullas Karanth</b> conducted a systematic survey on the endangered
            lion-tailed macaque in Karnataka (1983–84). His report confirmed that
            Kudremukha harboured one of the largest contiguous populations of these
            primates in the Western Ghats. He proposed using the macaque as a 'flagship
            species' to conserve the entire ecosystem. Based on his findings, the
            Karnataka State Wildlife Advisory Board recommended the creation of
            Kudremukha National Park.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three important rivers — <b>Tunga</b>, <b>Bhadra</b>, and <b>Nethravathi</b>
            — originate here. A shrine of Goddess Bhagavathi and a Varaha image within a
            cave are major attractions. Other spots of interest include the Kadambi
            waterfalls, known for wildlife such as Malabar civets, wild dogs, sloth bears,
            and spotted deer.
